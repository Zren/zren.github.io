{% capture label %}Folder Structure{% endcapture %}
{% capture sectionLeft %}

To start from scratch, first create a folder for your new widget somewhere in you coding directory (eg: `~/Code/plasmawidget-helloworld`).

Inside it create another folder called `package`. Everything inside the `package` folder will be what we eventually install to `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.github.zren.helloworld/`. Eventually we will zip the contents of `package` and share them online. We can keep text editor files, build scripts, screenshots, etc outside the `package` directory.

Inside the package folder will be a `metadata.desktop` file which is basically a Linux `.ini` file. This file will describe the name of the widget, the category it's in, and various other plasma specific keys like the main QML file.

Inside `contents`, we will create the `ui` and `config` folders. `ui` is the folder which should contain your layout files like the `main.qml` and the `configGeneral.qml`. `configGeneral.qml` is the layout of the first tab in the widget's configuration window.

Inside the `config` folder we have the `main.xml` which contains the schema of all our serialized configuration keys+values. The `config.qml` is used to define the tabs in the configuration window. Each tab will open a QML layout file (like `ui/configGeneral.qml`).

Note that you don't *need* the 3 config files. You can get away with just the `main.qml` and `metadata.desktop` for a barebones widget.

{% capture label %}metadata.desktop{% endcapture %}
{% capture sectionLeft %}

Inside the `metadata.desktop` file we need to set the `Name` of the widget. The `Type` should be `Service` since the `.desktop` file is not an app launcher and we don't want this to appear in the app menu.

`Icon` is the icon name associated with the widget. You can search for icon names in the `/usr/share/icon` folder. You can also look for an icon name by right clicking your app launcher widget then editing the icon in it's settings. It uses a searchable interface and lists them by category. Plasma's SDK also has the Cuttlefish app ([screenshot](https://www.kde.org/images/screenshots/cuttlefish.png)) which you can install with `sudo apt install plasma-sdk`.

`X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name` needs to be a unique name, since it's used for the folder name it's installed into. You could use `com.github.zren.helloworld` if you're on github, or use `org.kde.plasma.helloworld` if you're planning on contributing the widget to KDE.  

Widgets installed by the user (without root) like when you "Install New Widgets" will be installed to `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/` (which may not yet exist). The default widgets shipped with KDE are installed to `/usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/`.

`X-KDE-PluginInfo-Category` is the category the widget can be filtered with in the widget list. A list of category names can be found [here](https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Plasma/PIG).

`X-KDE-ServiceTypes`, `X-Plasma-API`, and `X-Plasma-MainScript` are also needed to just define that this package is a plasma widget, and where it's entry point is.

This is the entry point. Various properties are available to be set. You should know that widgets have several ways of being represented. 

* You can have a widget in the panel, which is just an icon that will show a popup window when clicked.
* You can also have it on the desktop as a desktop widget which can be resized by the user. As a desktop widget it can switch between the "icon view", which opens a popup, and directly showing the popup on the desktop when there's enough room.
* You can also have the widget inside another widget (a containment) like the system tray or the panel itself.
* The widget can also be run like an application in it's own window.

`plasmoid.location` and `plasmoid.formFactor` can tell you how the widget is placed. `plasmoid` is a global variable which is defined when you `import org.kde.plasma.plasmoid 2.0`. Read more below.

`Plasmoid.compactRepresentation` (with a capital) and `Plasmoid.fullRepresentation` are used to define the layout of the small "icon" view and the full "popup" view. These are both properties of the main `Item`. If neither are set, by default the main `Item` is the full representation.

If you change the compact representation, you will need to use a [`MouseArea`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-mousearea.html) to toggle the `plasmoid.expanded` property. See the [`DefaultCompactRepresentation.qml`](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-desktop/blob/master/desktoppackage/contents/applet/DefaultCompactRepresentation.qml) for an example.

`Layout.preferredWidth` can be used to define the default width of a panel widget, or the size of the popup window (unless it is in the system tray). The system tray has a fixed hardcoded size for it's popups. `Layout.preferredWidth` can also define the width of the compact "icon" view in the horizontal panel, not just the full "popup" width. Note that the `Layout.preferredWidth`/`Layout.preferredHeight` of the `Plasmoid.compactRepresentation` will automatically scale to the thickness of the panel depending on if it's a vertical or horizontal panel.

`Layout.minimumWidth` can be used to define the minimum size for a desktop widget / popup.

`width`/`height` (not `Layout.__`) can be used to define the default size of a desktop widget. Desktop widgets currently ignore `Layout.preferredWidth` when calculating the default size.

You can set the tooltip contents and various other things in the `main.qml`.

To show the text in the panel rather than in a popup:

{% highlight qml %}
import QtQuick 2.0
import org.kde.plasma.components 2.0 as PlasmaComponents
import org.kde.plasma.plasmoid 2.0

PlasmaComponents.Label {

    // Always display the full view. Never show the compact icon view
    // like it does by default when shown in the panel.
    Plasmoid.preferredRepresentation: Plasmoid.fullRepresentation
}
{% endhighlight %}

To set the popup size:

{% highlight qml %}
import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.Layouts 1.0
import org.kde.plasma.components 2.0 as PlasmaComponents
import org.kde.plasma.plasmoid 2.0

    // Always display the compact view.
    // Never show the full popup view even if there is space for it.

        Layout.minimumHeight: label.implicitHeight
